Carbon emissions
================

The **argopy** team is concerned about the environmental impact of your favorite software development activities.

Starting June 1st 2024, we're experimenting with the `Green Metrics Tools <https://metrics.green-coding.io>`_ from `Green Coding <https://www.green-coding.io>`_ to get an estimate of the energy used and CO2eq emitted by our development activities on Github infrastructure.

Here are the results:

- `Dashboard of all argopy energy consumption and CO2eq emission <https://metrics.green-coding.io/carbondb-lists.html?project_uuid=a5c7557d-f668-482b-b740-b87d0bbf5b6d>`_

- `CI tests running on each commit <https://metrics.green-coding.io/ci.html?repo=euroargodev/argopy&amp;amp;branch=master&amp;amp;workflow=22344160>`_

- `Upstream CI tests running daily <https://metrics.green-coding.io/ci.html?repo=euroargodev/argopy&amp;amp;amp;amp;branch=master&amp;amp;amp;amp;workflow=25052179>`_
